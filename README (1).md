Time series & Forecasting Bitcoin and Ethereum 

 
Description:
Bitcoin is the longest running and most well-known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus "chained" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred. As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow. Included here is historical bitcoin market data at 1-min intervals for select bitcoin exchanges where trading takes place. Happy (data) mining!

Ethereum (ETH) is a smart contract platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (DAPs) conceptualized in Vitalik Buterin 2013. ETH is the local currency of the Ethereum platform and serves as a transaction fee for miners in the Ethereum network.
Ethereum is the pioneer of blockchain-based smart contracts. Smart contract becomes a self-operating computer program when running on the blockchain, which automatically executes when certain conditions are met. On the blockchain, smart contracts allow the code to be programmed without the possibility of useless time, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It facilitates the conversion of money, content, property, shares or anything valuable. Ethereum Network went live on July 30, 2015, with 72 million Ethereum Premium.

Bitcoin is primarily designed to be an alternative to traditional currencies and hence a medium of exchange and store of value. Ethereum is a programmable blockchain that finds application in numerous areas, including DeFi, smart contracts, and NFTs.

Objectives:
•	Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
•	Perform the necessary checks like stationarity & DF on the Dataset.
•	Build a forecasting model to forecast prices of BitCoin. and Ethereum 

Stractegic Plan of Action:
1.	Visualize the time series - Check for trend, seasonality, or random patterns.
2.	Stationarize the series using decomposition or differencing techniques.
3.	Plot ACF/PACF and find (p,d,q) parameters.
4.	Building the forecasting model - can be AR, MA, ARMA or ARIMA.
5.	Making Predictions using the Forecasting Model
